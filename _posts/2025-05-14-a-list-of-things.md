During my time on the internet, I have been saving random interesting things I find. It could range from funny to whimsical, and originate from platforms from discord to instagram. It could even just be a word I really like, or a phrase, or a quote. I’ll be listing these in increasing order of value to me.

Regarding the quality of items on the list, I must mention that it’s not like I don’t care that much about the earlier ones. I’m ranking them as if I were ordering S to SSS items in a tierlist.

And it’s pretty hard, man.
<br>
<br>
### But I’ll begin.
<br>
- “Schadenfreude”
- [Super Mario World Ending Theme](https://youtu.be/b9IkpUYlOx8?si=rP-r_oB11mZXm6eA) sight-read by Tom Brier
- “Happenstance”
- “Crestfallen”
- “Zephyr: deemed one of the most beautiful words in the English language due to its euphony rare sighting and letter composition. Greek origin //ZƐF ƏR// Zephyr: a gentle, mild breeze. It does not disrupt, nor cause chaos, it merely brings a pleasant sensation on a warm summer day.”
- The Quiet Sadness of [Mario Galaxy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ1y75vxO0o&list=PLOcM-4gIkLVyN0pTxq-Wh2uIuORW_N7V5)
- [Amos, Amas, Amateur](https://www.vocabulary.com/articles/candlepwr/amo-amas-amateur/#:~:text=Its%20first%20three%20letters%20are,%2Fshe%2Fit%20loves.)
- “I can never read all the books I want; I can never be all the people I want and live all the lives I want. I can never train myself in all the skills I want. And why do I want? I want to live and feel all the shades, tones and variations of mental and physical experience possible in my life. And I am horribly limited.”
- “Moonshot”
- Gone But Not Forgotten. [Mr Chi-City Kicks it with a Friend](https://youtu.be/wK7GSARUs_Q?si=GjT1QExecqBo8g8Z)
- “One of the biggest magic-killers in the world is [labels](https://www.instagram.com/p/C_S4D25B7Ci/), brother.”
- "[J]ust as in the sciences we have learned that we are too ignorant to safely pronounce anything impossible, so for the individual, since we cannot know just what are his limitations, we can hardly say with certainty that anything is necessarily within or beyond his grasp. Each must remember that no one can predict to what heights of wealth, fame, or usefulness he may rise until he has honestly endeavored, and he should derive courage from the fact that all sciences have been, at some time, in the same condition as he, and that it has often proved true that the dream of yesterday is the hope of today and the reality of tomorrow." - Robert Goddard's... high school valedictorian speech?!?!
- THE HISTORY OF [SLIPPING ON BANANA PEELS](https://youtu.be/p8W5GCnqT_M?si=NrB0pQODCFIGQXEP)
- “Pinch me, I’m dreaming.”
- “This week I had one of the most illuminating experiences of my life. A bunch of teenagers and I were shipped off to attend a ridiculously funny lecture entitled 'Physics and Life' where a foreign physicist tried to explain everyday life using physics terminology. Did you know that the force of love is just the addition of the coulomb force and van der Waals force? Did you know that your happiness factor can easily be calculated through these graphs and simple straightforward equations requiring zero differentials? Did you know that marriage is merely a fusion reaction and divorce is fission? And kissing is merely a form of Total Inelastic Collision? And angular momentum is nothing but the motion of love?”
- Porter Robinson & Madeon - Shelter ([Official Video](https://youtu.be/fzQ6gRAEoy0?si=-ZDMLn9qd3uP4CEw)) (Short Film with A-1 Pictures & Crunchyroll)
- “[I could never do this](https://twitter.com/Keegan59992745/status/1886217607595938073). My liked songs tell the story of the last 5 years of my life. You guys are fake asf for abandoning a song just because you don’t like it now. How would 15 year old you feel about you getting rid of that XXXTENTACION song that they loved?”
- Easy super smelter [tutorial](https://www.instagram.com/p/DGGZP3UpFEx/)
- [ALIEN STAGE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYikmsPVq_c&list=PLpt7uDVri02Tc4nYYOwVrhY1R3c1DJgGE) (the entire playlist)

- Randy Pausch Last Lecture: [Achieving Your Childhood Dreams](https://youtu.be/ji5_MqicxSo?si=sTzZiP_ydBl3XGQ8)

### I will probably
add more to this list in the future, as I have many more bright years of doomscrolling ahead of me. So maybe come back later? Just know that I will continuously update the post date as I add more items.

With a light heart,
