## About


Hi, I'm amatAf, a high school guy who has a lot of interests and loves silly anime characters. I write more about myself in my [blog posts](https://amataf.github.io//blog/) so don't expect a full-blown introduction here. However, I will answer one of my frequently asked questions.

I have been questioned about the origins of my username ever since I created it in around the fall of 2024. Some people think that it’s just some random letters, others (understandably so) think that it means “amat as fuck.”

The first string of letters is “amat-,” the Latin prefix for love (seen in amative, amatory, amateur). When you take the “A” after it and “f”[lip] it, you get “∀,” the mathematical symbol for “for all.” Combine it all together and it’s “love for all,” which accurately describes my selfish desire to pursue subjects I am curious about.

Simply put, this username is a condensed analogous form of my self description, “an [amateur](https://www.vocabulary.com/articles/candlepwr/amo-amas-amateur/#:~:text=Its%20first%20three%20letters%20are,%2Fshe%2Fit%20loves.) at a lot of things.”
